This is a ChineseChess game program, which includes
* a simple GUI for people to play with,
* a minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning as the AI player
* a simple artificial neural network (ANN) library (implemented by myself)

One of the motivations of this project is to implement an AI player using ANN.
